                Centuries before Mahmud of Ghazni, the Shahs of Kabul had been one of the great powers of present-day Afghanistan. From the 7th to 10th centuries CE, they warred with Arabs and Afghans and allied with Kashmiris and the Khotanese. Their name might conjure up images of staunchly Islamic rulers, but in reality, the Kabul Shahs confound our binary expectations of the medieval world. Most Kabul Shahs were Buddhist or “Hindu” and descended from ethnic groups based in present-day Pakistan and portions of Central Asia. They coexisted with elephant-riding Multani emirs and Sindi Arabs who wore earrings inspired by Deccan Shaivite and Jain kings.

                The last edition of Thinking Medieval explored this world in a slightly later period (the late 10th and early 11th centuries) through the unexpected cosmopolitanism of Mahmud of Ghazni, the Turk who conducted jihads against Hindu and Muslim alike, commanding armies of South and Central Asians. But Mahmud’s activities, as we’ll see, were not particularly out of place in the multicultural world of medieval Afghanistan—one of the great crossroads of Eurasia.
