                    Shiv Sena MLA and Uddhav Thackeray's son Aaditya Thackeray has asked Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to name the Tata official who had said that the conditions in the state were not suitable for the Airbus project. Aaditya claimed that the project was shifted to Gujarat at the behest of the Centre. He accused the state government of losing thousands of crores of projects due to their negligence. Aaditya Thackeray said, "I challenge Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to name the Tata company official who said that the situation was not appropriate to set up the Airbus project in Maharashtra. Because what we know is that the Tatas were specifically told by the government that they have to set up the project in Gujarat."
